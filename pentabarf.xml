                          <description>A quick introduction to accounting and the free software solutions available in Debian.  This is a broad overview covering solutions for personal finances, freelancers, small businesses and non-profit organizations.  The talk will include a demo of some of the more advanced solutions included in Debian, the Postbooks and Tryton ERP systems, both of which have features like multi-user and multi-currency support and a full SQL backend.

This talk will show how free software solutions can do everything that is possible with proprietary software like Quickbooks and Sage while also giving the user more control of the underlying data and unlimited flexibility to adapt the system to meet future requirements.

Many small businesses start out using a minimal solution to avoid up-front costs but then experience significant effort migrating all their data to the system they should have chosen in the first place.  As free software doesn&#39;t have an up-front cost, businesses are free to choose the solution most suitable for their long term needs and grow into it even if they don&#39;t use many of the features in their first year of trading.</description>

                          <description>Are you a newcomer? In this talk Helen will discuss how a community composed of only volunteers is organized, what is a Debian Developer, how and by whom the packages  and repositories are managed from the upstream code to the stable release of Debian, and how you can contribute.

The talk will cover:

    * History of Debian: The origins of Debian (who created it, where the name came from), how it grew, where we are today (number of packages, arquitectures supported), who keeps Debian&#39;s logo, machines, donations.
    * The Foundation Documents: What are the Debian Social Contract, the Debian Constitution and the Debian Free Software Guidelines (DFSG), and what they talk about
    * Internal Organization and Hierarchy: Volunteers, Sponsors, Team, Debian Maintainers, Debian Developers, Technical Committee, Project Leader, .... What all these titles mean, how they are chosen and what their responsabilities are
    * The release cycle: What unstable/testing/stable means, how a package flows from the upstream author to the mirrors. How a new stable release is performed. What is main/contrib/non-free.
    * BTS and WNPP: How the bug tracker system is used to manage who maintains which package.
    * How to start contributing
    * Debian vs Ubuntu: what is the relationship between the two distros</description>

                          <description>Proponents of free software are frequently asked &quot;Can we replace Skype, Viber, Twitter and Facebook?&quot;.  Is this the right question and how does it relate to free software development today and in the future? Pocock talks about the social consequences of this issue, looks at some of the successes we have had with examples based on Debian, some of the challenges that remain and ways that people can help either as developers or end users.</description>

Oftentimes, technologists (i.e., software developers in this context) wonder why ‘technology/project A’ did not diffuse widely, and become celebrated as industry standards over ‘technology/project B’, despite its supremacy, meritocratic performance or significance in the relevant industry? Part of the answer to this question seems to lie in outer space of the technological sphere where industry dynamics, nature of contributors, and technology trajectories interact ensemble in order to give rise to a technological dominance. In this presentation, we will discuss the case of FFmpeg (an OS multimedia technology) as a useful OSS platform for data transmission within broadcasting industry. I further discuss the early empirical evidence, technical challenges, and the solid results. Later, I will explain the broader implications for the broadcasting industry and how and why it can become part of the standards.

                          <description>GNU and Linux are now embedded in more kinds of hardware than ever,
but nearly always only by requiring proprietary bits. The world&#39;s most
popular tablets and phones are based on a free core system loaded with
nonfree software on top. We are at risk of free software being used
primarily as a delivery vehicle to lower the cost of getting
proprietary products to market.

How do we get the freedom we all want, and what is the market for
that? The Free Software Foundation has a certification program called
&quot;Respects Your Freedom&quot; (RYF) that awards a certification mark to
hardware meeting a set of free software standards (fsf.org/ryf).
Embedded and IoT devices are a major target for the future of this
program.

RYF has already made significant gains, especially over the last few
years, certifying USB wifi adapters, 3D printers, home wifi routers,
and earlier generation laptops. A growing number of small companies
are competing on the basis of the certification, and crowdfunding
campaigns are citing meeting the standards as a key project goal. 

Even bigger things are planned, and most involve the embedded world.
Get updates on what&#39;s in store, learn what it takes to get your
product certified, hear about the impact of certification so far and
the community that has formed around the program, and discuss possible
improvements to the standards.

Can we turn our current &quot;free software invisible under the hood&quot;
reality into a reality where consumers can go into a store or shop
online and find clearly marked products that fully respect their
freedom?

                          <description>This talk will go into the list of features that MariaDB has received over the years from the community. We will talk about how the MariaDB team handles community contributions as well as what potential contributors can do to get their code accepted into the server.

This talk is aimed primarily at people interested in contributing to an open source project, but it will provide some useful insights for anyone looking to increase the interaction with the community for their own open source project.</description>

                          <description>While Debian packaging is often seen like a daunting task, there are now over 100 000 different software packages in Debian and most of those are maintained on a regular basis. This shows that it is perfectly possible to create and maintain Debian packages, yet a lot of  people do not exactly know how and simply assume someone else will package their tool for them.

This session introduces my personal [quick development guide](https://anarc.at/software/debian-development/) which was built from more than a decade of experience as a Debian contributor. My first experiences were as a bug reporter, then [backporting software](https://backports.debian.org/), then maintaining my [own packages](https://qa.debian.org/developer.php?login=anarcat&amp;comaint=yes) and finally working with the [LTS security team](https://wiki.debian.org/LTS) to backport weird security patches into older Debian releases.

It is an opinioned guide: not every tool will be shown and my bias will be towards the tool I know and use every day. I will try show you how to find resources to deal with the random Debian packages you will find. This session is a reroll of the [Montreal BSP](https://wiki.debian.org/BSP/2017/04/ca/Montreal/Announcement) (Bug Squashing Party) where I was invited to present my material to a broader audience. The workshop is also specifically geared towards backporting and bugfixing, although I can also help people get familiar with the basics of new package creation, depending on who will show up during the session.

If you have ever wondered how to work with Debian packages, to finally fix that gnawing bug that&#39;s been bugging you, or to get your favorite tool better packaged in Debian, this hands-on session should get you started. You do not need prior experience with Debian packaging to attend this talk, although some experience with Debian itself and especially command line tools is expected. This is a hands-on session: no time will be wasted on slides or long dissertations on how to do things. You should bring your laptop, the software you want to package, or the bug you want to fix, and we&#39;ll just get on with it.

While I will be leading the basic presentation and will bottomline the session, other Debian developers are welcome to join in and help users get familiar with Debian packaging.</description>

                          <description>Description: (English below) En mai 2016, FACiL ajoutait à son plan
d&#39;action triennal (2016-2017, 2017-2018, 2018-2019) l&#39;objectif fort
ambitieux de déployer et d&#39;offrir publiquement un petit éventail de
services libres, éthiques, décentralisés et solidaires. Ces services
seront sans pistage publicitaire, sans frais et fait en commun avec la
communauté de leurs utilisateurs et de leurs utilisatrices.
L&#39;infrastructure logicielle que nous bâtissons repose essentiellement
sur Debian GNU/Linux.

Le projet s&#39;inscrit dans le cadre du Collectif des Hébergeurs
Alternatifs, Transparents, Ouverts, Neutres et Solidaires (CHATONS)
initié par l&#39;association Framasoft, championne de la dégooglisation
massive de la France occupée par les Google, Apple, Facebook, Amazon et
Microsoft (GAFAM) de ce monde.

La dite occupation étant planétaire, FACiL se propose de faire sa part
pour livrer bataille au Québec, avec l&#39;aide de ses partenaires locaux et
internationaux.

Découvrez l&#39;état d&#39;avancement du projet de FACiL et aussi comment vous
pouvez y prendre part dès maintenant!

[English version of the proposal]

/In May 2016, FACiL added to its three-year action plan (2016-2017,
2017-2018, 2018-2019) the ambitious objective of deploying and offering
to the public a small range of free-as-in-freedom, ethical,
decentralized and community-oriented online services. Theses services
will be without tracking, without fees and built in common with the
community of their users. The software infrastructure that we are in the
process of building rests essentially on Debian GNU/Linux.

The project is part of the CHATONS collective initiated by non-profit
organization Framasoft, the champion of mass degooglization in France,
which is currently occupied by the Google, Apple, Facebook, Amazon and
Microsoft (GAFAM) of this world.

The said occupation being planetary, FACiL proposes to do its part to
fight battle in Québec, with the help of its local and international
partners.

                          <description>What?
Join us to contribute to the new meals-on-wheels management platform. This software has been developed in partnership with the non profit organization Santropol Roulant (https://santropolroulant.org) in order to help similar community organizations manage and deliver meals to elderly people or those with disabilities.
Developed on Django (Python and JavaScript), the platform has been operational since this spring but there are still needs for improvements and new features.
Sous-chef is free software under Affero General Public License 3. It was built by a collaborative effort between Santropol Roulant, Savoir-faire Linux and the developer community and students in Montréal  (Montréal Python , Pyladies Montréal , Montréal Django, Maison du logiciel libre). 
To get more information see http://souschef-project.org/ (in french).
Who?
Please note that the event is targeting people who know Django but are not necessarily experts with it. We also accept all kinds of contribution (translation, documentation, etc). Don&#39;t be afraid and join us :)
How? 
A presentation of the project and of Santropol Roulant will precede the contribution workshop. Participants will be able to :
*Learn about a large Django application that uses the state of the art methods and tools ;
*Contribute on project tasks or propose improvements :  https://github.com/savoirfairelinux/sous-chef
*Discuss about future involvement in the project.

-Bilingual event-


Du logiciel libre pour les communautés des popotes roulantes : Atelier de contribution pour Sous-chef

Quoi?

Joignez-vous à nous pour contribuer à la nouvelle plateforme de gestion du service de popote roulante. Ce logiciel à été développé en partenariat avec l’organisme à but non lucratif Santropol Roulant (https://santropolroulant.org) afin de doter les organisations similaires d’un outil adapté pour gérer et livrer des repas aux personnes à mobilité réduites.
Réalisé en Django (Python et JavaScript) et opérationnel depuis le printemps, Sous-chef reste dans une phase de développement actif pour l’améliorer et apporter de nouvelles fonctionnalités.
Sous-chef est un logiciel libre distribué sous licence Affero General Public License 3.  Il est issu d&#39;une démarche collaborative entre le Santropol Roulant, Savoir-faire Linux et les communautés de développeurs et d’étudiants impliqués (Montréal Python , Pyladies Montréal , Montréal Django, Maison du logiciel libre).
Pour plus d’information sur le projet : http://souschef-project.org/

Pour qui?
Vous n&#39;avez pas besoin d&#39;être expert! Une connaissance de Django est requise pour les contributions au code et tout autre type de contributions sont acceptés (traductions, documentation, etc). N’hésitez pas à vous joindre à nous :) 
Comment?
Cette activité débutera par une présentation du projet et du Santropol Roulant qui précédera l&#39;atelier de contribution. Les participants pourront donc :
* En apprendre sur une application Django d&#39;envergure qui utilise les méthodes et les outils qui sont à la fine pointe ;
* Réaliser des contributions sur des tâches du projet ou proposer des améliorations : https://github.com/savoirfairelinux/sous-chef
* Discuter des possibilités d&#39;implications futures.

                          <description>Unicode: we&#39;ve all heard of it, but what is it exactly?

There are a lot of misunderstandings around it: is it a 16-bit encoding? Is it only an encoding, or is it something larger? Are there special requirements as programmers or users to use Unicode and the related facilities?

We will introduce the concept of Unicode: what it originally was, compared to what it is now.
We focus on its key concepts: What is a code point? A grapheme? What is normalization, what does it change? How does Unicode change the way we manipulate text?
As developers, what should we do to take that into account?

This quick overview aims to demystify everything by giving a quick overview of the basics of Unicode, the traps one might encounter when dealing with it, and how to avoid them.</description>

                          <description>Ring is free software for universal communication which respects the freedoms and privacy of its users. The program allows users to communicate with each other without relying on a centralized server to relay messages.

Ring has recently joined GNU. It is still mostly developed by Savoir-faire Linux, a Free Software consulting company based in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. It is based on SFLPhone, which was a SIP/IAX2 compatible softphone for GNU/Linux.

The presentation will take a look at the growing privacy concerns related to modern communications software and explore Ring’s solutions.</description>

                          <description>Memory-Driven Computing, as demonstrated in The Machine prototype,
offers a radical transformation in computing hardware, breaking down
old barriers between memory and storage, and across operating systems
instances. We&#39;ve been building on Debian to explore how software could
use the hardware, building a storage management layer and offering
inter-system collaboration mechanisms through the memory fabric.

Our current project, Linux for Memory-Driven Computing, expands on our
previous work by offering portability to more hardware platforms, both
real and virtual. This software is delivered as a set of packages
which install on top of an existing Debian Buster system.

This talk will describe our &#39;Manifesting System&#39; (which builds
customized operating system images for each node), and how the system
deals with errors in massive amounts of memory, and how we plan to
make containers take advantage of Memory-Driven Computing to speed
application deployment. The talk will conclude with some future ideas
about managing a tightly coupled multi-node memory driven system.</description>

                          <description>The last status report from the Publicity team was during DebConf15. Since then, we have revamped the team with a new delegation, started micronews.debian.org and had to deal with one of the most difficult news item ever. </description>

                          <description>At DebConf Heidelberg I talked about how Free Software has a lot to do about consensually doing things together. Is that always true, at least in Debian?

I&#39;d like to explore what motivates one to start a project and what motivates one to keep maintaining it. What are the energy levels required to manage bits of Debian as the project keeps growing. How easy it is to say no. Whether we have roles in Debian that require irreplaceable heroes to keep them going. What could be done to make life easier for heroes, easy enough that mere mortals can help, or take their place.

Unhappy is the community that needs heroes, and unhappy is the community that needs martyrs.

I&#39;d like to try and make sure that now, or in the very near future, Debian is not such an unhappy community.</description>

                          <description>In free software circles, a disturbing number of conversations treat
it as given that fewer new projects are choosing copyleft licenses,
and more are going the route of lax permissive. Though this has been
repeated in news articles and blog posts, when we look deeper for
evidence of the claim, we find either anecdotes (often from the field
of corporate-backed project license choices), or highly questionable
and unscientific data sets.

Sometimes the claim is repeated by people just trying to set the table
for other discussions about trends in free software or open source;
sometimes it is promoted by people specifically arguing against
copyleft (especially in business); sometimes it is raised as a concern
by people defending copyleft. All three situations are worrisome in
their own ways.

I&#39;ll discuss:

1) recent &quot;data&quot; and articles published, including my own analysis;

2) whether the contexts in which permissive license use does appear to
be increasing mean what they are purported to mean, and whether those
contexts are actually relying purely on permissive licenses or on
other sorts of supplementary legal structures;

3) prominent instances of copyleft usage, especially the AGPL and GPL;
and

4) different ways to study and understand the trends people are trying
to get at when they talk about licensing choices in quantitative
terms.

In a community with so many computer scientists, lawyers, and talented
researchers, it&#39;s important that we habitually put popular assumptions
up for critique. Assumptions and bits of conventional wisdom need to
be audited just like code, to ensure that the business plans and 
movement-organizing decisions which flow from them aren&#39;t based on
rotten foundations.

                          <description>pypi2deb is a project for people that don&#39;t like to install Python libraries system-wide using tools other than apt/dpkg or for people that want to
create new Debian source package and don&#39;t want to repeat all the boring parts that can be automated. 

There will be a demo of two tools:
* py2dsp (which converts PyPI package to Debian source package)
* pypi2debian (which converts PyPI repository to Debian repository)

You can expect examples of how to customise them, use within packaging teams, etc.

                          <description>One of DebConf&#39;s recurring activities is the Key Signing Party. It helps Debian strengthen and expand its web of trust. 
This session will:

• Explain how keysigning is done in a DebConf setting

• Validate the SHA256 hash of the KSP coordination document

• Explain how to participate to people who did not send their keys in time

                        <title>Debian Science - umbrella for scientific packages or dustbin for scientific code?</title>
                        
                        
                        
                        
                        
                        
                          <description>The Debian Science mailing list was created in 2005 and in 2008 the Blends framework was implemented to turn some random discussion into a structurised team with dedicated coders and packages.  Later other existing packaging teams maintaining scientific software were merged and since about 2013 the Debian Science Blend is covering most of the scientific packages inside Debian which do not have any specific Blend team (like DebiChem, Debian Astro, Debian Gis and Debian Med).  It tries to serve as entry point for scientists with an interest to package some software for Debian or seeking help with some scientific software.  The original idea of the quite general Debian Science was that it could serve as an umbrella as long as there is not yet sufficient manpower inside Debian to be able to run an own Blend for a certain topic.  This has worked out for Debian Astro which is a pure offspring of Debian Science - so the concept has at least one example that it can work.

However, there are also things regularly criticised:  Debian Science does a bad job to pick up packages where Uploaders vanished from the team without notice and several packages are in a bad state.  Admittedly this is the case to some extend.  It is caused by the fact that scientists tend to move to different projects or institutions and do not find the time to sort out their code heritage.  While this is effect is neither new nor unknown inside Debian this kind team orphaned packages sometimes shades a bad light onto the team.  While there are some team members who are doing a great job in picking up such orphans forming kind of Debian Science internal QA team not all cases are covered.  At least the good news is that it is very easy to take over an orphaned package by team uploads or even adding an ID as Uploader.

The audience of the talk are all people interested in scientific software.  I try to present ideas how we could strengthen the &quot;umbrella side&quot; even more over the &quot;dustbin side&quot; by concentrating more dedicated  people for certain topics.  Ideas how to reach out further into scientific groups to gather more team members are welcome.

                          <description>Outreachy is yet another internship for newbies. It closes gap between &quot;uses&quot; and &quot;contributes&quot; and gives certain categories of people a good motive to start making the world to be a better place.
Every Outreachy intern requires personal approach to work with. Yet this &quot;personal&quot; doesn&#39;t mean something too different from approach applied to any other program&#39;s intern.
We are going to tell how we learned about Outreachy and why we decided to choose Debian. Why internships matter. We are going to provide our personalized view to internship process and how to be motivated enough to finish it. 
And we will draw a precise portrait of a Perfect Internship Mentor :)
 
We also want to talk about why CI for Debian packages matters and how it helps us and our friends in everyday work and career and provide some examples. And how hard it is to stay (and why you should stay).
 
Writing tests can sometimes be boring and routine, and we are going to provide some approaches we used to semi-automate it. Yet it doesn&#39;t mean it can be automated fully, because every package is unique and often only after you take a closer look  you can build a good tests and find a bug no one else fixed yet.

                          <description>Debichem is a Debian pure blend that focuses on chemistry-related software. While it was easy to package all FLOSS projects in the field back in the early 2000s when Debichem started, nowadays the number of upstream projects has increased considerably while the number of  project members as stayed consistently low over the years.

This talk will give an overview of what&#39;s new for Debichem in stretch, and what the plans for buster are.</description>

                          <description>MariaDB 10.3 has had its first release. 10.3 has a focus of extending existing supported SQL to support Oracle-style PL/SQL. This talk will go into what the MariaDB developers have planned for the upcoming stable version. Other features include community contributed such as user defined aggregate functions and audited tables using &quot;AS OF&quot; syntax.

We will also go into our current and future plans for MariaDB in Debian, given how MariaDB (10.1) now ships as the default MySQL variant in Debian 9. We hope to have a discussion with the audience regarding concerns of this change, as well as what other things the MariaDB Foundation could do to aid in this transition.</description>

                          <description>Linux distributions are often based on Debian software, and these forks tends to vanish into thin air, when the creative phase and possibly the funding disappears. Maintaining a distro is not as fun as designing one.

Let&#39;s save some distributions from an early death! Part of our vision is for blends to be easy to customize and for the customizations to be easily copied and maintained. We wish for all customization to happen in Debian, thus making forking obsolete.

The Debian Design Team would like to present a draft on how this goal may be obtained, and discuss how this idea might be implemented in Debian distributions.</description>

                          <description>Discussion session for the Debian website team:

 * (re)Design work for the future
 * VCS Migration
   + exactly what are we going to do
   + what&#39;s the new workflow?
   + who&#39;s doing the work?
   + do we care about keeping history post-migration?
 * Overall workflow
 * Content - what do we have? Enough? Too much? 

Potentially many more topics, could be a busy session!</description>

                          <description>Endless OS is a pretty atypical Debian-based distribution, where a filesystem tree managed by OSTree, is exposed to users instead of traditional packages, and applications are completely managed with Flatpak.
In this talk I will go through how we use Debian tools to put together the distribution and the lessons we&#39;ve learned during that process.</description>

                          <description>Flatpak uses unprivileged Linux containers to install and sandbox desktop apps.

This talk gives an overview of how Flatpak and its portals behave and how they&#39;re implemented, both on the packaging/distribution side and the sandboxing/security side. It will also cover what problems Flatpak sets out to solve, the situations where Flatpak can help Debian achieve world domination by complementing what we already have, how it compares with other technologies, and the situations where some other technology (such as apt or Docker) is a better tool for the job.

The intended audience for this talk is Debian maintainers with general packaging/sysadmin knowledge, but not necessarily a desktop or freedesktop.org development background.</description>

                          <description>MediaWiki is a free and open-source wiki software package written in PHP. It scales extremely well, and is powerful enough to power the extremely high-traffic Wikipedia, but also run on shared hosting setups. It was previously packaged in Debian, but removed from jessie due to being significantly out of date and having unpatched, known, security issues. Working with other Debian contributors who are part of the MediaWiki community, I took over the package and updated it to MediaWiki&#39;s latest version, and prepared it for the stretch release.

This talk will mostly cover social aspects of packaging a pretty large web application for Debian, and the different steps taken in interacting with the upstream community as well as the Debian community. As I was pretty much an outsider to the Debian development community, I&#39;ll talk about my experiences getting started and some of the initial impressions with contributing to Debian. I&#39;ll also discuss some strategies I used to get other MediaWiki contributors to contribute indirectly to Debian and help with packaging efforts.

The intended audience is for people who may be interested in getting into Debian development, but as outsiders find the process daunting, or Debian community members who want to make the process easier. Finally, I&#39;m also going to try and recruit MediaWiki community members who are in Montreal for Wikimania to attend, and would use the common topic to introduce new members into the Debian community.</description>

                          <description>Presented by:  Jeffrey Kaufman, Open Source IP Counsel at Red Hat, Inc. and Adjunct Professor of Law at Thomas Jefferson School of Law. 

The current state of litigation between Oracle and Google provides a fascinating perspective on copyright fair use in the context of software APIs.  This exciting 45 minute presentation will put the audience in the jury box to obtain an important and unique perspective on why the trial returned a unanimous verdict in favor of Google, essentially concluding that the copyright fair use doctrine allowed Google to use JAVA SE APIs in its implementation of Android.    The presentation will conclude with a group discussion on potential impacts to the open source community.  A brief background on the case will also be provided.  

This presentation is targeted towards software programmers, product managers, and program managers involved in software development and policy making.  Anyone writing or using APIs would find this talk of interest.   

After attending this talk, the audience will have i) a clear understanding of the history and current state of the Oracle v. Google litigation, ii) clarification on why APIs may still be subject to copyright protection, and iii) when API use may be a &#39;fair use&#39; under the law as a result of this litigation.

                          <description>In 2002 some crazy Debian developer had the idea to pick some orphaned low popcon packages inside Debian covering life sciences and decided to add some more of this field and some covering the field of medicine.  Since that time the project gained some traction and convinced several people and institutes using Debian instead of some other Linux distribution.  While the outer view on the project which is called Debian Med Blend is quite good the Debian internal view does not really reflect the potential that Blends actually have.  Are you aware that more than 1% of the Debian developers confirmed that they are Debian developers only because the Debian Med project exist?  Can you imagine more of those Blends making Debian attractive in several workfields?

If you are not interested in life sciences and medicine at all this talk is for your despite the fact that it is covering Debian Med.  I&#39;d like to prove on the example of Debian Med why Blends are helpful for the future of Debian, how the active support of Blends inside the Debian could have a positive effect onto the acceptance of Debian inside these workfields and beyond.  Blends have the power to bump the maintainer-package relation to a team-topic relation and can enhance the quality of packages covering a whole topic.

                          <description>This talk is for Debian users and contributors interested in FreedomBox, which configures Debian as an easy-to-use personal server. The first part will cover the current status of the project, including current feature set in Stretch, supported platforms, and ongoing development work.

The next part will be a technical overview of FreedomBox and the main packages that it depends on. A live demo of using the FreedomBox via the web interface will be shown. There will also be information on the current setup process, and live image builds.

Next, I will also suggest ways in which the wider Debian community can help support FreedomBox, such as packaging needs and configuration. At the end, we will have a Q&amp;A and open discussion on opportunities for collaboration between FreedomBox and other parts of Debian.</description>

                          <description>Debian Edu / Skolelinux is a Debian blend targetting education facilities. Over the past five years, I have been supporting Debian Edu / Skolelinux at four schools in Nothern Germany.

This talk will give a quick summary of our lessons learned while selling Debian Edu / Skolelinux as a product to end customers. If people attend the talk and show interest in discussion, we may set up a BoF spontaneously after the talk.

                          <description>While founding the Tanglu Debian derivative, I did set up infrastructure to create and maintain a Debian archive (which includes Britney, Ben, Dak and friends) and maintain it for the derivative, which resulted in some custom code being written for Tanglu. Doing this turned out to be quite a big task for a small derivative which requires a lot of continuous human work.
After I started working on PureOS for Purism[1], I had the pleasure of doing the same thing again. Having learned the lesson in Tanglu, I developed a framework for setting up and maintaining infrastructure for a Debian derivative, called Laniakea.
Laniakea uses tools already present and in use at Debian itself, but allows to centrally manage them and aggregate their information in one database.
This allows to automate a lot more archive actions, saving human manpower, as well as showing new developers a nice coherent web interface for their packaging.

This talk will be about what Laniakea wants to be and what it can already do today for your derivative, and how it differs from other solutions like Fedmsg. I will also likely contain useful information in what (not) to do in case you are brave enough to attempt to set up your very own infrastructure based on the tools we use to build Debian.

                          <description>I&#39;ll talk about what changed in APT since last DebConf, and what plans we have for the future. 

* Reworking automatic updates and unattended-upgrades to work more reliably and predictably - when and how does apt do stuff automatically?
* A look at porting APT to FreeBSD and macOS (the latter being WIP)
* Moving the https method away from curl and into the standard APT package
* An overview of new features and changes

                          <description>Being students who started their contribution to Open Source through Outreach programme which Debian supports, we (Urvika and I ) would talk about two major open source initiatives – Google Summer of Code and Outreachy.
Our objective would be to talk about How we got selected into these programmes, about the interesting tasks we got to do, how It helped us grow as developers and about the warm Debian community we got to experience.

Urvika would share her experience being an Outreachy Intern with Debian. Outreachy is a similar program like GSoC but it helps people from under-represented groups such as females and LGBTQ, to get involved in open source software. 
She would like to share her journey of getting into Outreachy in the hopes of inspiring budding female developers like her.
She would talk about how being on Outreachy team changed her perspective from “how to code&quot; to that of “how to contribute&quot;.

Pranav would be sharing his working and learning experience during Google Summer of Code’16 with Debian.

Both, Urvika and I worked on the same project – Lumicall. We would talk about free - RTC  and to share importance with the audience. We would talk about “Lumicall” which is a free and convenient app for encrypted phone calls from Android. We would be explaining the work we did using Android and Java to add new features into the existing application and how to pace the learning curve.

To explain what kind of work we did under these programs, Urvika would also give a brief about a few concepts that she worked on using Android/Java
Explaining what “WhiteLabelling” is and how can we implement it in Android
Working with productFlavors, How to add a silent mode feature by specifying time and weekdays, How to set bubble background image in Chat/Message screen using 9 Patch images.

I, Pranav would briefly explain about adding PUBLISH Support to Lumicall and developing a library for adding quick enroll option to Android Applications.


We would share how we got into these programs and what it takes to successfully complete it. 
Hoping it would help someone having questions like “How to get started with Open Source” and “How Can I contribute” to &quot;How I Went From Newbie to Open Source Project Contributor &quot;.</description>

                          <description>Roche Diagnostics International Ltd is using GNU/Linux in medical instrument products and has developed “Roche Linux”, a Debian-based distribution. This talk aims to show why Debian is well suited for our purpose, how we are using it and what we’ve built on top.
We would like to share our experience with the Universal OS and how we address the challenges of developing Medical Software. The deployment and upgradability of each software layer is more and more important not only for meeting security requirements but as well for speeding up the development and software validation. To respond to these demands we developed a build pipeline tool based on Debian repositories and the Debian Build toolchain.

                          <description>Techniques and tools for using git for Debian packaging continue to develop, though there remain many pain points.  Since last year&#39;s DebConf, dgit, in particular, has seen a lot of development.  The new possibilities for using this tool have not yet been fully explored.

The starting point for this BoF will be a brief demo of some of elements of the pure dgit workflows that have only become possible in the past year: a merging workflow and a rebasing workflow (if `git debrebase` is not finished by DebConf, the design of this tool will be explained).

A possible follow-up discussion would be figuring out what Debian package maintainers consider the highest priority pain points for maintaining Debian package in git: Should we be focusing on a new source package format?  Is it documentation that is lacking?  Is it our conventions regarding the BTS and NMUs that are blocking progress?  Etc.</description>

What can/should we do to help?

                          <description>There are many in-person Debian events apart from DebConfs including Bug Squashing Parties, hackathons, summits and sprints. These have not only been socially rewarding but incredibly productive for the project.

This BoF will touch on all subjects around easing organisation of events, plus ideas on how to improve existing ones - what works &amp; what doesn&#39;t.</description>

                          <description>The talk is for people interested in Free Software Games who want to learn more about the current state of games and related developer tools in Debian. I will present a short history how the games section developed over time and how it presents itself nowadays and what might happen in the future. I will talk about the Debian Games Blend and how everybody can help to promote and improve games with or without programming skills. While the talk is mainly focused on FOSS games I will also present tools like game-data-packager and how software distribution platforms like Steam have influenced gaming on Linux.

                          <description>jenkins.debian.org shall become what jenkins.debian.net is, except it should run (the service) on a DSA maintained system (some of the nodes doing the work might not be DSA maintained…)

This workshop is about the transition from jenkins.d.n to jenkins.d._o_ and how we can make it happen and how we can make it good.

It will also give an overview about the 1400 jobs running on jenknis.d.n and how to contribute new jobs or modify existing ones.

                          <description>Let&#39;s all come together and enjoy treats brought by attendees from all around the world.

Lactose, mold, grapes and ethanol, everything is optional.

The only imperative is that the stuff you bring is edible/drinkable, can be shared, and that (at least some) people will enjoy it! Bonus points for intriguing artifacts from your corner of the world.</description>

                          <description>LXD is a modern container manager and REST API written by LXC upstream and built on top of the LXC library.
Its goal is to offer the same features you would expect from a Virtual Machine hypervisor but using Linux Containers rather than VMs.

This makes it a very light and fast alternative to virtual machines and an ideal option when running Linux in both guest and host.
Some of the main features include:
 - User friendly command line experience
 - Entirely built on top of a REST API (easy remote management)
 - Fine grained resource management for containers
 - Support for device passthrough (network, disk, unix char devices and unix block devices)
 - Helpers to ease GPU and USB passthrough
 - Network management API (create bridges, setup tunnels between hosts, ...)
 - Storage management API (create storage pools for containers, use any of btrfs/lvm/zfs/directory backends)
 - Support for live migration (through CRIU)

The presentation will go over what LXD is in greater details, include a brief overview of its API and be followed by a demonstration of its various features.

LXD is available for Debian users through snapd with native packaging being worked on.
A number of Debian images for LXD are built and published daily.</description>

                        <title>LTSPManager: how 1000+ Greek schools switched to Debian-based distributions</title>
                        
                        
                        
                        
                        
                        
                          <description>In the past 10 years, more than 1000 Greek schools switched their computer labs to Debian-based distributions. The reason for this was the extremely easy-to-use combination of the following software packages:
 * LTSP (Linux Terminal Server Project): netboot all the (diskless) clients from a single image on the server.
 * Epoptes: a Greek classroom monitoring tool (for the teachers), which was debianized a few years ago.
 * Sch-scripts (ltsp-manager): a Greek computer lab administration tool (for the sysadmin).

The part of the puzzle that is missing from Debian is sch-scripts. Traditionally, managing a computer lab with LTSP requires familiarity with the command line, but many schools can&#39;t afford a sysadmin. Sch-scripts offered an easy-to-use GUI and proved that a simple teacher can maintain a computer lab with that.

A Debian Outreachy 2017 Project called &quot;LTSPManager&quot; aims to adapt &quot;sch-scripts&quot; into a new Debian package called &quot;ltsp-manager&quot;, primarily through internationalization and localization as well as documentation. We hope that the Greek schools success story can be adopted by a broader audience.

A developer of LTSP/Epoptes/Sch-scripts is the Outreachy mentor for ltsp-manager and will be presenting the technical side of the story,
while a Greek teacher is the Outreachy intern for ltsp-manager and will be presenting the school/teacher side of the story, along with the challenges she faced as an Outreachy intern.</description>

                          <description>The free software community has created a tremendously valuable resource and built an amazing community, now we just need to make sure that it lives on forever. Ideas that have lasting power thrive inside communities that take care of themselves and plan for growth. New members are valued and time is spent to bring them in and teach them the core values that underpin the work. Successful organizations also pay attention to the world around them. They either work to shape changes to their benefit or they adapt to the things they can&#39;t affect or don&#39;t want to affect.

Many communities have created long-lasting endeavors based on shared values and we can too. We have to be willing to arrange our work so that we are always looking to the future. Our tools and our tactics must match our desire to build a movement that will be around for decades -- possibly even centuries -- to come. By constantly and conscientiously passing the torch, we make sure that those who will come after us will be able to joyfully continue the work we&#39;ve started.

                          <description>Ansible is a popular Open Source tool for agent-less automation and orchestration.
We will briefly introduce with the state of Ansible in Debian, then we will
present the various ways of managing Debian servers with Ansible. Particularly
for services configuration, there are different patterns depending on how configuration
files are organized (file structure, data structures, languages…).
Our audience is primarily system administrators using configuration management tools.
Some parts could also be interesting for package maintainers in order to ease the use
of automation tools with Debian.</description>

                          <description>The target audience is anyone interested in an automated integration testing where unit under test is run inside a VM. No OpenQA knowledge is assumed - this is meant as a brief introduction to show the potential of the system to people that know nothing about it. By the end of the presentation, the audience will know the basics of how OpenQA works and how it is used to release a daily, fully tested Linux distribution.

The presentation will cover

   * what is OpenQA
   * how it functions via VM screen and serial monitoring and mouse/keyboard interface
   * quick video of it installing Debian
   * an example of how it is used today to test and release a daily distribution - OpenSUSE Tumbleweed
   * an example of how a test is defined

The idea is to rebuild and install any package and its reverse build dependencies in a freshly vmdebootstrapped virtual machine. Ansible is used as a configuration management tool.</description>

                          <description>Some have suggested that work needs to be done to increase the visibility/popularity of Debian. This was in fact a plank in both candidate DPL platforms this year.

But, are the strategies we pursue to boost the Debian brand the most effective way to achieve the goal? Analysis suggests that tasks such as increased marketing and outreach don&#39;t address core factors holding up growth, and that there are other, simple strategies that would be more effective.

This talk will present some of these alternative strategies, with supporting evidence of their efficacy. </description>

                          <description>This talk is based in a paper I have published where I describe a pattern language (as in &quot;design patterns&quot;) for automated software testing in production-like environments (a.k.a autopkgtest/DEP8 for us Debian people). The patterns describe common problems and solutions for testing Debian packages, and should be useful for maintainers willing to add tests to their packages.

                          <description>In the near future various upstream projects related to the Ubuntu desktop experience as we have known it so far may become only sporadically maintained or even fully unmaintained. Ubuntu will switch to the Gnome desktop environment with 18.04 LTS as its default desktop. The Application Indicators [1] brought into being by Canonical Ltd. will not be needed in Gnome (AFAIK) any more. We can expect the Application Indicator related projects become unmaintained upstream. (In fact I have recently been offered continuation of upstream maintenance of libdbusmenu).  

While looking into the Unity Greeter code over the past years and actually forking Unity Greeter as Arctica Greeter [2] in September 2015, I also started looking into the Application Indicators concept. And I must say, the more I have been looking into it the more I have started liking the concept behind Application Indicators. The basic idea is awesome. However, lately all indicators became more and more Ubuntu-centric and IMHO too polluted by code related to the just declared dead Ubuntu phablet project.   

Saying all this, I recently forked Application Indicators as Ayatana Indicators. At the moment I represent upstream and Debian package maintainer in one person. The goal is to provide Ayatana Indicators to all desktop environments that want to use them, either as default or optionally. Release-wise, the idea is to strictly differentiate between upstream and Debian downstream in the release cycles of the various related components.

The Ayatana Indicators upstream projects are currently hosted on Github under the umbrellas of the Arctica Project. Regarding Debian, first uploads have recently been accepted to Debian experimental. The Debian packages are maintained under the umbrella of the revived Ayatana Packagers team.

In this talk I will give a quick overview on the current status of above named efforts and reasonings behind my commitment to the work. Most of the time during this BoF I would like to get into discussion with desktop maintainers, possibly upstream developers, Ubuntu developers, etc. Anyone who sees an asset in the Indicators approach is welcome to share and contribute.

                          <description>The maint-guide package used to serve as the &quot;tutorial&quot; for the Debian packaging but recently is becoming out of sync with the modern Debian packaging practices and it lacks practical packaging examples.  I have created the debmake package which is a Multi-arch aware packaging helper and rewrite packaging tutorial as the debmake-doc package.  I would like to discuss how to improve this situation. 

I would also like to discuss how to make this new tutorial document to become accepted and also get more people to make similar documentation efforts by making documentation work more attractive for the new contributors.   There are both merits and demerits with lowering entry barriers.  I would like to elaborate on ideas to encourage new contributors.

Also, I would like to raise awareness to the practical challenges of maintaining DEP-5 compliant debian/copyright file when updating the package with changing licenses. </description>

                          <description>Apertis is a Debian-derived platform for infotainment in automotive vehicles.

Being a Debian derivative, Apertis doesn’t use typical Debian infrastructure software. Having managed the build infrastructure of Apertis for some time, I’m going to share my experience, and talk about how we use Open Build System (OBS), Jenkins and other tools to provide continuous integration and package and image builds, and how we solve issues we sometimes have.</description>

                          <description>I&#39;d like to briefly share my experiences with enabling support for
several ARM boards in Debian over the last years, and use this to
highlight some of the issues encountered.

Debian-Installer has had support for various flavors of ARM systems
for quite some time, and it&#39;s arguably better now than ever... but
it&#39;s still a very rough road. Some of that is just because ARM is,
well, difficult, with individual boards requiring specific
configuration. But some of it is in the design of debian-installer...

I&#39;d like a broad, open discussion to consider various methods of
installing and configuring Debian systems:

* Could we make installing from live images a default option? How
  could that simplify things, and what would we lose?

* configuration management systems such as puppet, ansible, chef,
  propellor, etc. are widely used. How can this be integrated into an
  installer?

* image-based creation tools (e.g. vmdebootstrap) are used to create
  ARM bootable images for many systems.

* with virtualization and containers increasingly common, how does
  debian-installer fit in?

                          <description>One guy&#39;s experiences leaving the Debian project after 18 years as a developer. What to expect when you leave Debian good &amp; bad, tips for a graceful exit, and what does leaving Debian even mean? Also how to social engineer yourself back into the DebConf cheese and wine party years later.

And that&#39;s just the first half of this talk.

Second half: Demo of a Haskell program that connects to a Debian mirror and does ... something or other ... to a VM. Featuring bad XKCD style stick figures and lots of typos^Wtypes.</description>

                          <description>Discussion session for people working on (and those interested in) the topic of UEFI Secure Boot in Debian.

We&#39;ve not made the progress a lot of us were hoping for (getting Secure Boot
into the Stretch release), and that&#39;s depressing given how long we&#39;ve
been talking about this and some people have been working on the changes needed.

We need to remove the blocks, and a face-to-face meeting should help with
that I hope.

Agenda:

1. Where we are today 
2. Where we want to get to
3. Tools and processes - how does it all work? How would we do it better?
4. What are the next steps needed?</description>

                          <description>The Debian anti-harassment team has been setup as contact point for Debian event organizers willing to have an anti-harassment policy.
It&#39;s also a contact point for members of the Debian community that want to inform about violations of the Debian Code of Conduct or the DebConf Code of Conduct.
Most of the issues that arrive our mailbox are about minor violations of the Debian Code of Conduct (unrespectful behavior or language, for example).
In this BoF we&#39;ll explain briefly how do we try to help to solve or de-escalate those issues, we&#39;d like to receive feedback or suggestions about how to improve, and we&#39;d like to open discussion about how the community as a whole can work towards a more welcoming and respectful environment in Debian.</description>

                          <description>DevOps, CI, IaC, TDD, TDI, Pipeline, Cloud everything and tons of new 
terms are growing in the software garden becasue there is a new way. But 
what happen if this new way is not in line with values like Free 
Software and Privacy? can we play this new game keeping our dear Debian 
in the equation?

We are doing a small setup for a EFF like organization in our country 
and we want to share with you how we are doing this &quot;new way&quot; with Open 
Source technologies like Proxmox, Packer, Vagrant, Gitlab, Docker and 
for sure, Preseed and Debian.

Learn how to build a trusted Debian KVM image with Paker, then run it 
with Vagrant, provisione Docker and see how we use Gitlab-CI build, test 
and deploy software and infrastructure after someone push the git repo. 
We merge form devel to staging to get it running in a KVM instance at 
Proxmox. finally we merge to master to get it in production.</description>

                          <description>In order to create their software packages, Debian maintainers perform a series of steps that include cloning of upstream sources, debianization of files, testing, linting, and packaging. Taken together, these steps make up the package’s software supply chain.

The security of this supply chain is crucial to the overall security of the software product. An attacker who is able to control a step in that chain, such as the version control system, the build process or the *debianization* steps, can alter the product for malicious intents. By introducing backdoors or including vulnerable libraries in any of these steps, or in between, attackers can target all of Debian&#39;s users at once.

Although existing point solutions, like VCS signing or reproducible builds, provide integrity and authentication to individual steps in the software supply chain, they provide little security to an already compromised product. Hence, there is a need to verify the integrity and authenticity of a project from inception to the installation on an end user&#39;s device.

In this talk we present *in-toto*, a set of tools to define, carry out, and verify the integrity and authenticity of any software supply chain as a whole. The presentation will include a live demo.</description>

                          <description>Debian has infrastructure to ensure that users obtain unmodified versions of packages, but once they&#39;ve hit disk that chain of trust vanishes. debsums allows admins to verify that the packages hash to a value stored in the dpkg package database, but in the face of active attack that provides no guarantees - an attacker can simply modify the stored hashes to match their modified binaries. The easiest approach is to use a read-only filesystem, but what if there were a stronger way to provide these guarantees without making system updates more difficult?

IMA, the Integrity Measurement Architecture, provides an in-kernel mechanism for verifying that binaries match associated signatures stored in extended attributes alongside the executable. These signatures can be generated at any point in the packaging process, from package build to archive processing. And with a simple addition of functionality to dpkg (already in progress), these signatures can be written out at package install time, allowing users to configure systems such that distribution binaries won&#39;t run if they&#39;ve been tampered with.

What needs to be done to make this possible in Debian? Is it worth the effort? And how do we do this in a way that avoids systems being locked down in ways that limit user freedom? This presentation will attempt to answer all of these questions.</description>

                          <description>An operating system&#39;s utility is largely defined by the software it can run. Such software is commonly installed and updated using package managers, library managers or application updaters that communicate with remote repositories or mirrors. As such, software installation and updates are strongly susceptible to attacks. Whether it is smuggling in backdoors,
refusing to update important features and security patches, or crashing the updating client, the attack scenarios are widely diverse, but all can be costly.

As a consequence many existing software update systems offer security mechanisms that seek to prevent such scenarios. Two important concepts to provide authentication and software integrity are transport layer security and cryptographically signed files.

This talk reveals the limitations of the above security mechanisms, and presents an alternative. TUF is an update framework that uses multiple levels of delegation, key thresholds, and both implicit and explicit trust revocation, to not only shield users against a variety of attacks, but also make update systems especially resilient against key compromises. TUF is the first software update infrastructure that is resilient to compromises of both the repository and signing keys. It has been standardized by several groups, including Python, and is used in production by many communities, including LEAP, AppContainer, Flynn, Docker, and several automotive vendors.  Some mechanisms and concepts from TUF have already been integrated into apt.</description>

                          <description>It&#39;s been 20 years since the Debian Free Software Guidelines were published as part of the Social Contract. In that time, free software has spread further than we could ever have imagined - everything from cars to watches are now dependent upon free software for at least part of their functionality. But in that time we&#39;ve also seen huge shifts in how software is used and how it&#39;s written, with people both becoming more dependent on remote services and on income related to free software development work. People now depend on free software to keep them safe from abusive governments, partners or parents, but have we become any better at designing and writing systems that ensure that their safety is preserved? And even though we&#39;ve pioneered open discussion of diversity issues, why is free software still overwhelmingly produced by white men?

This talk is intended to challenge the status quo, to encourage us to revisit some of our preconceptions about what&#39;s important about free software and what&#39;s incidental, and to start a discussion on what the next 20 years of free software development and community growth should look like. </description>

                          <description>For more than two decades I&#39;ve been using Debian as my primary and only OS on my primary computer (and almost all others computers I&#39;ve been touching), and in February 2017 I finally made the switch and installed Qubes OS, which currently is based on Fedora 23 (while 26 is their latest release).

That said, I&#39;m still (mostly) running and developing Debian inside Qubes OS, as - very roughly said - Qubes OS is just another virtualisation layer between the CPU and the user.

So in this talk I will explain in more detail what Qubes OS is, what advantages using Qubes OS brings, what downsides it has and how I made my transition to a more secure setup, and what challenges I faced. Of course I&#39;ll also explain why I went with using the Fedora based Qubes OS instead of porting it to Debian and what options there are for a future with a Debian based Qubes OS.

                          <description>Supporting stable packages means porting patches back to older versions of the same code. Most of the time, that is not a direct and easy task. You have to find the patch (sometimes more than one), try to apply them, fail, do it by hand, compile, fail, repeat. This process is tedious, slow, and error prone.

We present a coming new tool to make security patch porting easier. The system we propose collects and applies patches from different sources and displays the results in an easy to compare way. It applies several heuristics to port the patch to the target code and adapts them to be directly importable to quilt. As a work in progress, the presentation will have a section for discussing future paths and ideas. Everybody is welcome, especially developers or contributors with some experience in patch porting.</description>

                          <description>In this short talk, basic organization of GnuPG 2.1 will be explained by demonstration, so that people can understand better.  The intended audience is general Debian users.  Crypto expert also could enjoy the demonstration about separation of data management, but detail of crypto algo or implementation will not be explained.

GnuPG 2.1 is now in Debian Stretch.  While it comes with new features like ECC support, most important change is its architecture;  In GnuPG 2.1, it consists of sub components (gpg command line front end, gpg-agent, dirmngr, scdaemon, etc.), and each component has its own role.

Focusing major use cases (encryption, decryption, signing, checking signature, and OpenSSH authentication), we will demonstrate the basic organization of GnuPG 2.1 by our family members.
Cast plan (not yet decided, will be changed):

    gpg: Ayumi (daughter)
    gpg-agent: Hitoe (wife)
    dirmngr: Hiroshi (son)
    scdaemon: gniibe (me)

                          <description>I will explain about HOWTO Ed25519 / X25519 (the new ECC).

GnuPG 2.1 (in Stretch) supports Ed25519 signature and X25519 encryption.
The key is short, crypto computation is fast, and strength is considered good enough.

In Debconf 15, I was asked about how to generate Ed25519/X25519 keys and wrote an article:
    https://www.gniibe.org/memo/software/gpg/keygen-25519.html

It is also supported by OpenSSH.  (Although we can&#39;t put ssh-ed25519 keys to Alioth, yet.)

Sure, it is supported by Gnuk Token, and it&#39;s quite useful because it&#39;s faster than RSA.</description>

Then, in a second part of this talk, I will cover a more specific talk on the changes to cloud-init test and development automation. The team now has initial integration test cases utilizing Linux Containers (lxc) to prevent regressions and have future plans to develop and expand these across a KVM-backed and to actual clouds.

                          <description>Debian has participated in Outreachy, an effort to include more people from underrepresented groups in free and open source software. This talk will explain why efforts like Outreachy are important to free software and provide an overview of how the program works. Karen will also share some of the metrics that demonstrate the impact of the program, for Debian and other participating free software projects.</description>

                          <description>[Software Heritage](https://www.softwareheritage.org/), the universal source code archive, was announced to the public in 2016. During DebConf in Cape Town, we opened [our own source code](https://forge.softwareheritage.org/) to the world. Since then, we have [opened up our API to the public](https://archive.softwareheritage.org/), and Inria, our umbrella institution, [signed an agreement on software preservation with UNESCO](http://en.unesco.org/news/agreement-software-preservation-signed-unesco).

So far, we have archived more than 3 billion source files, spanning almost 800 million revisions across 60 million projects. Our primary focus was the archival of version control systems, as this is where the history of software is being preserved right now and will be in the future. We have now laid out most of the ground work, and our infrastructure is (mostly) humming along, so we&#39;re ready to go further and to take in contributions from the community !

We want to give a status update on the last few months of development, and to show the areas with which we would welcome help from the community: listing new data sources, archiving Linux distributions, ... The sky is the limit!</description>

                          <description>The Debian Bug Tracking system Debbugs is rapidly approaching 1
million bugs and 90,000 unique correspondents, and is still central to
the release and development process of Debian. We will examine the
history and statistics of bug reporting in Debian, discuss the changes
being made to make Debbugs faster and help maintainers cope with
additional bugs. We will also explain how developers can contribute to
Debbugs and join the Debbugs development team.

                          <description>Deborah Nicholson and Molly de Blanc want the free software movement to keep growing and one facet of successful movement building is embracing a multi-generational community. The good news is that there is no age requirement for using, promoting and contributing to free software. The bad news is that we aren&#39;t always doing a great job of facilitating a diverse, inter-generational movement. We&#39;ll take a look at what we&#39;re currently doing to bring in young people, how we are treating older people in our communities and where there is room for improvement.

Using examples from other movements and inter-generational communities, we&#39;ll identify tactics that aren&#39;t being used to build the free software community and see what we can collectively port over. We plan to inspire the audience to find ways to recruit and retain young people, inspire older people to participate and maintain an unbroken thread of free software conservatorship.

This session is accessible to anyone with a general knowledge of what free software is, and that open contribution communities power many free software projects.</description>

                          <description>Debian and the Free Software Foundation, along with its GNU Project, share many goals and ideals. They are two of the most mature and dedicated organizations working in the free software movement. This is a great opportunity to talk in person about how they can better work together and learn from each other.

FSF members (and potential members) will meet to talk about the FSF&#39;s work, and relationship with Debian:

  * A very brief update by the FSF&#39;s executive director on highlights of the FSF&#39;s work since the last DebConf
  * Feedback (positive and negative) from members, and a little brainstorming about what the FSF should and shouldn&#39;t be doing
  * A review of the current relationship between the FSF and Debian
  * A discussion of areas for collaboration, focused on projects that could be completed or significantly advanced before the next DebConf

Past sessions at DebConf have led to concrete positive results like collaboration on the hardware database at [https://h-node.org/](https://h-node.org/). Let&#39;s have another productive one!

                          <description>Debian includes a number of packages intended for designers of electronics systems.  These include tools for capture, simulation, analysis, and physical realization of electronic designs.  This session will start with a brief report on the current state of electronics package maintenance and some upstream changes and challenges, then move to an open discussion on whether we have the right tools packaged, how to get more people involved in maintaining them, and generally how to improve the state of the electronics packages in Debian.</description>

                          <description>Free Software advocates have long argued that the issues are political: e.g. freedom.  Open Source advocates have argued that the issues are Engineering -- that Open Source is better software engineering than the alternative.

What if the Open Source thesis is wrong?  What if Open Source practices contribute to more poorly engineered software?  What if the rationale for Open Source software is freedom?

This will be a discussion around the reasons why open source software development produces poorer quality software -- but perhaps not so much poorer that the tradeoff is worth it for the added freedoms.

Also, proposals for ways to modify standard open source practices to mitigate or resolve some of these problems.</description>

                          <description>Collaborative software-development groups face dual demands in technical debates: analyzing participant-concerns rationally, while keeping organizational cultures healthy. Codes of conduct help, but some argue that being nice is antithetical to critical intelligence, just as group intelligence may be lost when feelings run strong, or when minority perspectives are bullied into silence.

Sometimes social issues do not matter in technical debates, and sometimes they do. This talk introduces specific methods of getting beyond &#39;objectivity versus subjectivity&#39; and &#39;facts versus values&#39; conflicts in technical-policy discussions. The presentation will suggest learning to hear conflicts like a facilitator, noticing technical debates that do not hinge on social issues at their core. We will identify those factual types of debates and how validating their solutions differ from other conflicts, and how to tease out the differences. The first step is about learning and recognition. 

Suggestions offered here are based on the Theory of Communicative Rationality, of Jurgen Habermas.

                          <description>Whilst anyone can inspect the source code of free software for malicious flaws, software in Debian is distributed pre-compiled to end users.

The motivation behind the Reproducible Builds effort is to permit verification that no flaws have been introduced — either maliciously or accidentally — during this compilation process by promising identical results are always generated from a given source, thus allowing multiple third-parties to come to a consensus on whether a build was compromised.

This talk will explain the current status of the Debian Reproducible Builds project, what has changed in the last year, how this is relevant to you as a maintainer, and how this is relevant for the complete free software eco system and, finally, how you can contribute.</description>

                          <description>When asking partners of Debian developers - as far as not both partners are DDs - many will answer with a more or less clear &quot;yes&quot; when being asked whether the partner is married with Debian.  So my wife would surely do.  Luckily this non-physical partner in many cases gives back nice gifts like a reliably working computer, interesting traveling destinations ... and not to forget friends.  As we all know lots of DD became parents over the years.  We even had a grandfather - father pair (Robert and Kirk Hilliard) and thus a more generation family. (I&#39;m working on it as well.)
However, it turned out that you can even get children together with this non-physical partner.  In my talk I&#39;d like to simply chat about the way I&#39;ve got a daughter because Debian exists.  If you are curious how it is possible to find new family members in Debian, feel free to join a non-technical talk showing photos and telling a story about coincidences, chances Debian can give and how Debian can bridge between continents.  I&#39;d be more than lucky if my dear daughter Minh will be able to come to Montreal and have this talk together with me.</description>

                          <description>LXC is a userspace interface for the Linux kernel containment features. Through a powerful API and simple tools, it lets Linux users easily create and manage system or application containers.

This talk will explore LXC packages in Debian and take a case study on how LXC can be used to interact with Android devices by installing various distros, versions of software within LXC. It will also touch upon / provide an overview of Debian based LXC implementation within LAVA (Linaro Automated Validation Architecture).</description>

                          <description>Whalebuilder is a tool for building packages in a clean environment using Docker images.  In this talk, I will talk about my motivation for writing it, compare it with other similar tools, discuss how I use it, demonstrate some of its features, and discuss future plans.</description>

                          <description>This talk focuses on a journey to build a Debian-based network operating system distribution for data center networking hardware. While Linux networking has been deployed and accelerated by hardware on servers, hypervisors and network processors for decades, data center networking hardware has run on closed operating systems and software since the very first computer networks were created. By riding a new wave of open networking hardware, Linux has been gaining a lot of new ground in data center networks. Network hardware and software disaggregation has opened the doors to leverage and extend existing Linux platforms and ecosystems to new data center networking features. In this talk I will show how Linux networking can be accelerated with an open networking hardware switch. A greater part of this journey has been to make a Linux network operating system distribution synonymous to a server operating system distribution. The examples in the talk are from Cumulus Linux, a Debian derivative.

This talk will cover:

- A brief overview of open hardware and ONIE, the Open Networking Install Environment
- Hardware networking features
- The latest in Linux kernel networking and hardware offloaded to network switches
- The latest in the Linux networking user-space and ecosystem</description>

                          <description>Currently piuparts.debian.org only tests Debian amd64. In this BoF we want to discuss how to scale this to multiple architectures and possible how to rewrite the web UI so that it scales with both more architectures as well as with 10 times more suites than it was written for.

Basically if you are interested to help by writing a nice(!) webapp, you should attend this BoF. Or to put it differently: if you want to help Debian, but don&#39;t know how, this could be your opportunity to contribute to a rather central QA tool in Debian!

Scaling piuparts to support multiple architectures could be done using two ways: the dumb and the smart way, where the latter uses a bit less hardware ressources but will require a bit of python coding. Join if you want to help here. (Also, we could start with the dumb way and later switch to the smart way…)</description>

                          <description>The idea for this session it to get together and as discuss all things autopkgtest/Debian CI and any related aspects. If you have ideas on how to test your package but don&#39;t know exactly how to wire things up for running with autopkgtest, want to share your joy and/or your frustration with the tools or with the environments, or have tips or questions on writing autopkgtest tests, this is for you.

autopkgtest runs tests on binary packages. The tests are run on the package as installed on a testbed system (which may be found via a virtualisation or containment system). The tests are expected to be supplied in the corresponding Debian source package. See adt-run(1) and /usr/share/doc/autopkgtest. Depending on which virtualization server you want to use, you need to install additional packages (schroot, lxc, lxd, or qemu-system)

Debian CI (ci.debian.net) runs autopkgtest against the entire Debian archive, Adding autopkgtest tests to your package will automatically make those tests run on Debian CI as soon as the package hits the archive.</description>

Bdale was there, and is willing to answer these and other questions.  Come ask and listen!  And if you, too, were part of Debian way back then, come help fill in the gaps...

                          <description>Debian has a long history in embedded usage. But today many people first think of Yocto when it comes to embedded Linux. The reasons are not only related to the countless Yocto-based board support packages on the market. There are benefits over standard distributions. However, if you step back from the messy details you easily run into when doing this for profit, you may wonder: &quot;Do I really need to build EVERYTHING from scratch when the degree of customization gets less and less?&quot;

Combining the best of both worlds is the goal of the Isar image build system: a huge pool of pre-built, well tested, long maintained Debian packages with the flexibility and reusability of image descriptions via bitbake and Yocto-like layers.

In this talk, we will provide an introduction to this approach, explaining the motivation based on first industrial application scenario. When does it take more than a simple bootstrap script while building product images? We will furthermore point out why we were specifically choosing Debian as foundation, and were we see a place of this approach and its tooling inside Debian, embedded and maybe also beyond.</description>

                          <description>Debian runs on many kind of civil infrastructure embedded systems, such as industrial IoT gateways, healthcare devices, trafic control systems or power plant turbine controllers. The Civil Infrastructure Platform (CIP) project has started the creation of an open source &quot;base layer&quot; of industrial grade software to enable the use and implementation of software building blocks in civil infrastructure projects. To make this &quot;base layer&quot;, we think that Debian is one of the most important projects to collaborate with. CIP member companies have experience making products based on Debian, not only from binary packages but also source packages.
In this talk, Yoshitake will explain why CIP members use Debian and how they adapt Debian for each use case:

   * How to create customized root file systems based on Debian source or binary packages.
   * How to fix Debian source code for cross-compiling.
   * OSS license compliance.
   * Long-term maintenance industrial requirements.
   
Yoshitake would also like to discuss how to contribute and collaborate with the Debian project.

                          <description>Modern cars are nowadays becoming very mobile computers and future average car is expected to multiple, powerful computers in it. As an open source developer I recently joined BMW for the development of the computing platforms for their future cars. In this talk I will share the basic outlines of what the computing platforms in a future car look like, what open source tools and projects are being used for these developments and how. I will also describe what impact Debian development processes have on software in the cars and what could be done to make this collaboration tighter and more effective in the future.</description>

                          <description>Dissertation available here: http://platypus.pepperfish.net/~dkscully/mres-sociology-impact-of-gender-women-in-debian.pdf

In 2016, as part of a Master&#39;s degree in Sociology and Research Methods, I did a piece of qualitative research interviewing women involved in Debian, intended to investigate how they felt that their gender impacted on their experiences of the project on a day to day basis.

I would like to present my findings, with some added discussion as to how such data might be useful for the project when considering diversity and inclusion.

Hopefully, it would be interesting to anyone with an interest in the functioning of the community, both currently and in the future.</description>

                          <description>After many Debian stable versions trying to align Debian with LSB (or is it the reverse?), Stretch got released with a restrained support of the LSB; Buster will remove more LSB compatibility packages.

How did this happen, and why? Will it make the LSB obsolete, or is it the final nail in Debian&#39;s coffin, condemning it to eternal uselessness?</description>

                          <description>DebConf is an itinerant conference. Every year, teams interested in hosting DebConf in their countries / cities present a first version of their bids, to get the attendance excited, to feel how much work is there for them to do, and... just for fun!
The DebConf bid is **not** selected during this session, but it is an important and traditional element of our conference. Teams can bid for DebConf at their city for basically the remainder of the year, and the winning location is decided usually towards March.</description>

                          <description>The pkg-postgresql team packages the core Postgres database server/client, the supporting postgresql-common infrastructure, as well as numerous extensions and 3rd party projects around it. In addition, some of its members also maintain the official Postgres APT repository at apt.postgresql.org. This repository hosts not only the default Postgres version per Debian (and Ubuntu) relase, but also all other upstream supported versions.

This talk will present how Postgres works in Debian/Ubuntu, give an overview of the pkg-postgresql team&#39;s work, highlight some of the most useful extensions and projects and also briefly present the changes in Postgres between the releases for jessie (9.4) and stretch (9.6), as well as in the upcoming 10 release.

                          <description>The node ecosystem; team (un)maintained packages; (very) out-dated javascript packages; jquery-goodies.

Lots of stuff that isn&#39;t going very smoothly in this very loose team. Let&#39;s come together to meet and greet and see if we can improve our cooperation. E.g by learning approaches and incentives. </description>

                          <description>The idea is to enhance the Debian infrastructure to enable our migration agent (britney2) to take results from autopkgtests into account when deciding on migration of packages from unstable to testing. In this session, I want to update the audience on what ideas we have, how far we are, and what still needs to be done.

As the way to use this is apparently a hot topic, I&#39;d hope there is room to discuss how we as a community like migration to be based on this.</description>

                          <description>Debian is the Universal Operating System. It runs perfectly well on servers, embedded devices and - duck-and-cover - the desktop. Universal? Todays ubiquitous all-purpose computing device is the mobile, smart telephone. In its beginning, free software, open hardware, and Debian were relevant. The OpenMoko phone has been released only two weeks after sales start of the first iPhone. Then Android, based on the Linux kernel, took the world by storm. Not everybody is, however, satisfied with using Android, not even if it is Replicant without any proprietary applications. To some, the app model is clearly inferior to Debians packaging approach.

What Is To Be Done?
 - Which kind of hardware is sufficiently open or documented to work with a free operating system?
 - What changes does Debian need to run on mobile device, esp. in respect to energy management and limited resources?
 - Which desktop environment and end user applications would work with very small screens and do work with a touch interface?
 - Which programs are missing compared to e.g. free Android versions and F-Droid apps?</description>
